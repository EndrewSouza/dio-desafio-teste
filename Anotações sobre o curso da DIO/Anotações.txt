During classes, I learned about pattern recognition which involves a set of steps to accomplish complex tasks, similar to baking a cake. This approach is applied in programming by breaking down complex projects into smaller pieces. Abstraction is the intellectual process of isolating an object from reality and observing its properties and characteristics.

Generalization is making something more extensive or broader. Algorithms require building methods using diagnostic tests and input/output instructions like those found in conditional statements.

Conditional structures come in two forms: single conditions that determine whether or not certain operations are executed; chain conditions can check multiple criteria before running specified commands if any apply.

In terms of Git/GitHub, common command-line functions include CD for navigating directories, MKDIR for creating new ones, DIR for displaying files in the current directory, DEL/RMDIR for deleting full directories (recommended after emptying).

Finally, Git requires specific lines of code such as ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C endrew8745@gmail.com to generate authorized SSH keys followed by eval $(ssh-agent -s) and ssh-add id_ed25519. Cloning a repository without any data can be achieved via git clone followed by the appropriate GitHub URL/
